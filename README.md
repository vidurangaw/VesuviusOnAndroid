VesuviusOnAndroid
=================
Sahana Vesuvius web application is designed to use via desktop computers. Over the years it has been used on many disastrous events successfully. But it has a big disadvantage which is the difficulty of deploying it on emergency situations where limited resources are available and have very less time to configure the system.  

This project mainly aims on creating an Android based application which can deploy a Vesuvius instance on the device itself instantly without any configuration what so ever, which then can be access by any other Wi-Fi enabled device via a Wi-Fi hotspot created by the same device. Creating a mobile friendly responsive theme for Vesuvius is also included in this project.
